                    Hello! I'm Luisangel, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                    with a minor in Computer Engineering, at the University of Houston. As a junior, I 
                    am passionate about expanding my skills both in and out of the classroom. When I'm not 
                    studying, you will see me connecting with others, playing sports, and exploring new technologies!
